incident response

Incident types:
When concerning ourselves with cyber incidents, we consider the following types of incidents
- Advanced targeted attacks
- Malicious code
- Unauthorized access
- Improper usage
- Loss of theft

the incident lifecycle:	APMARR
assess -> prepare -> monitor -> alert -> respond -> recover
	1. Asses and prepare: Understanding the current threats and capabilities-> implement adequate security measures based on assessment
	2. Monitor and alert: Monitor abnormal behaviour/communication and anomalies within the company: provide timely alerts and notify proper chain of command
	3. Resond and recover: Respond adequately to incidents: Mitigate damage and recover system operations to resume business as usual

Severity of incidents:
	Threat management -> Security monitoring
	Incident management -> CSIRT (computer security incident response team)
	Cyber crisis management -> MET (major event team)

Threat actors:
	Organized crime
	State actors & terrorists
	Script kiddies
	Hacktivists
	Insiders
Tools & technologies:
	Spam/Phishing/Pharming

Our definition of a crisis:
	A catastrophic, unforeseen incident that jeopardizes the critical assets, reputation, and/or financial standings of an organization or community
	Credibility is also at stake when managing a crisis. How you handle a situation can seriously impact how the world views you as company
A few examples of a crisis:
	ING bankgin DDOS
	Schiphol Power outage
	Ashley madison 33 milion accounts leaked
	WanaCry Ransomware - 200.000 victims and counting
	NoPetya ransomware - Maersk loses 378 milion in dollars

PREPARE
	Structure: Operational -> Tactical -> Strategic
	Governance: Clear mandate, tasks, responsibilites
	Process: Notification and escalation process
	Plan: Official and activated plans, including all crisis
OODA: Obtain situational understanding and regain the initiative
	Observe
	Orient
	Decide
	Act
PEAR:
	People
	Environment
	Assets
	Reputation

After looking at some old virus examples, we talked about hacking phases, namely:
	1. Reconnaissance
	2. Scanning
	3. Gaining access
	4. Maintaining access
	5. Clearing your tracks

Types of hackers:
	White hats:	Have permission, don't mean harm
	Grey hats:	Don't have permission, but also don't mean harm
	Black hats:	Don't have permission and very much mean harm
